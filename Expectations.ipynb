The break points are set very low for ease of illustration, and mean that if there have been 4 or fewer messages sent and received within the last 10 time periods (inclusive of the current time period), the hospital's busyness is low, if there were between 4 (exclusive) and 6 (inclusive) messages, the hospital's busyness is medium, and if there were more than 6 messages, the hospital's busyness is high. At the current level settings, any match event is likely to lead to a high busyness level due to the large number of subsequent related events. Of course, in practice the break points would be high enough one match in isolation wasn't sufficient to achieve an increase in busyness level!\n\nWe also declare the relative weightings to be assigned to different types of **within** expectations. Here, `foreignAcceptance` expectations are given a weighting of 1 under all three levels, while `localAcceptance` expectations (representing actor decisions) are given a weighting of 1 under the low level, 0.5 under the medium level and 0.333 under the high level. `foreignAcceptance` expectations will be set to be those in which the current Actor expects that a offer or request they make will be accepted by another agent in a certain time frame. `localAcceptance` expectations will be set to expectations about acceptance made by the current agent. When a given hospital is busy, it may alter its expectations on how quickly it responds to requests, but will not necessarily alter its expectations on how quickly other agents respond to it. The `localAcceptance` and `foreignAcceptance` arguments can be specified as an additional parameter to a `within` clause.",
