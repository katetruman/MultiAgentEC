   "source": "In the organ donation scenario and other product tracking scenarios, we have resources and orders which require resources to complete. In the organ donation scenario, our \"orders\" are the patients on the organ waiting lists, and our \"resources\" are the organs which are offered for donation. In this scenario, it is the resources that are the limiting factor - we have to wait for a donation offer to be made in order to match a donor and a recipient / recipients. This is contrast to many other scenarios, where we can stockpile our resources but have to wait for an order to be made to know which resources to allocate it at the time. \n\nAn example of such a scenario would be a business which makes furniture. A certain amount of furniture can be made in advance of orders, so we acquire resources and must wait for a customer order in order to move the stock. In the furniture business scenario, we may also be able to accept orders for furniture that has not yet been made. Thus, such a scenario requires lists of both existing resources and orders. In the organ donation scenario, we create a list of organ \"orders\", but do not need to store organ \"resources\" for future orders due to the quick turn around required between a donor's death and their organs being transplanted.",

   "source": "The following diagram shows the main events needed to facilitate resource to order matching in a generalised scenario. We will use the furniture store example to explain the meaning of the events. The monitoring system can be thought of as the main agent for a business or organisation.\n- The **monitoring system** receives **resource add requests** from a **resource provider** agent. In the case of a furniture store, this could be the store receiving notifications about wood suitable for furnitute making which is available from a particular mill.\n- The monitoring system is able to either **accept** or **reject** the **resource add request**. If a request is accepted, the resource list detailing currently available resources will be updated.\n- **Customers** can make **product orders** which the monitoring system can **match** with available resources, **reject**, or add to a **waiting list**.\n- When a new or waiting order is matched with available resources, the monitoring system sends a match notification to the relevant agents. This could include the **resource** provider, the **customer** and any **supporting agents**. The monitoring system then waits for each of the notified agents to **accept the match**. While there may be certain scenarios where the customer shouldn't need to confirm their order, in this case we assume that they do need to. In the furniture store example, a **supporting agent** could be the courier service for transporting the furniture, and they have to confirm they have the capability to accept a large order before the monitoring system fully processes it.\n- Once all agents who have been notified about the match have accepted it (if required), the monitoring system **confirms the match**. After this point, any actions that need to occur for the customer to get their order are undertaken.\n\nIf the image below is not displaying properly, you can view it [here](https://github.com/katetruman/MultiAgentEC/blob/master/ActorImages/general.png).\n<img src=\"ActorImages/general.png\" width=\"800\">\n",

The monitoring system either matches the donor offer to one or more patients on the waiting list, or declares that no match could be found.

We wish to model our agents as having distinct events and fluents, and thus messages must be sent in order to share information. A message is received one time period after it is sent. We can use the `causes/3` predicate to declare that one event causes another to occur at the next time period.
